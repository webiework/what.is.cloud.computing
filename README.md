Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the data and the software programs to run it.

Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.


## Types of Cloud Services

**Regardless of the kind of service, cloud computing services provide users with a series of functions including:**

* Email
* Storage, backup, and data retrieval
* Creating and testing apps
* Analyzing data
* Audio and video streaming
* Delivering software on demand
* Cloud computing is still a fairly new service but is being used by a number of different organizations from big corporations to small businesses, nonprofits to government agencies, and even individual consumers.
